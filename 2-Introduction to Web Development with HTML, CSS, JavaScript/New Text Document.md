#Front-end  # Back-end  #  Full-stack
In this brief overview,we'll lean about: The basic communication between client and servers.
How websites are built and displayed. Front-end development is about what happens on the
client side. Back-end development is about what happens on the server. Full-stack development
incudes both front-end and back-end development.

To create a website, web developers usually use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.
These languages are designed to work in conjunction with each other:
	HTML is used to create the physical structure of a website.
	CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colors, fonts, designsand layouts.
	JavaScript is anobject-oriented programming language that is used in conjunction with HTML andCSS to add interactivity to a website. (Use JavaScript to add log-in functionality to that button.)
